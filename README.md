# MRV Collective Brand
## About 
The MRV Collective is a not-for-profit, design and build, MRV solutions organization. We are an industry coalition of MRV (Measurement, Reporting & Verification) companies and organizations working to make MRV more affordable, reliable and scalable in order to accelerate investment in nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, ecosystem collapse and biodiversity loss.

We promise data integrity backed by scientific rigor and informed by traditional ecological knowledge with a sense of urgency and a culture of reciprocity.

## Mission
Our mission is to demonstrate the power of MRV technologies, close the nature-finance gap, and hasten the adoption of nature-based decision making in key political, economic, cultural, and social sectors.

## Vision
We envision a world where nature is valued and respected by all sectors of society and actions taken to protect the Earth are backed by data integrity, scientific rigor, and guided by traditional ecological wisdom.
